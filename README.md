MSFT Bot Implemenatation with Service Fabric Backend Connection and Xamarin Frontend Solution. The bot is easy to integrate in Skype also :)

This is our first kind of working version of a MSFT bot implementation. Search the source code for "ENTER YOUR ... HERE" to add your own keys and secrets for connecting your bot to the core and frontend implementation.
More infos will follow as we extend this example to a real and nice working version of a first starter project for your own bot implementation. 

So stay tuned! And try to get hands on now! :)

If any blockers occur don't hesitate to address me, Manu @codePrincess or Robin-Manuel @einRobby at Twitter or raise an issue here on Github.
